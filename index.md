**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I think the most interesting topic covered this quarter is the intersection of physiological data and behavioral measurements, specifically how wearable technologies and sensors can be applied to model behavioral health variables such as stress. Stress is a relatively challenging target variable as there's no standardized measurements or definitions for it, but it's interesting how stress detection is still possible through uncovering underlying patterns captured by wearable signals.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Given that we have both objective data through wearable signals and subjective data through self reports, I'd like to investigate if it's possible to build a model that doesn't just predict stress, but is able to minimize the gap between self-reported stress levels and stress levels inferred from wearable devices.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Right now we are only looking at a just a few features to esnure we can build a robust baseline model, but I'd like to incorporate more lifestyle features next quarter (e.g. food intake, sleep quality, etc.) in order to better capture the nuances and contexts of real-world settings and daily living, thus creating a more accurate digital twin.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'm interested in integrating knowledge graphs that can learn relationships between similar individuals or different interventions in order to create more personalized digital twin models. I would also be interested in incorporating LLMs that enables a more interactive framework and personalized analytics.
